These folders contain the data used in various formats throughout this entire
project.


Below is a brief explanation of what is contained in each folder.


/aggregate/       := the aggregate daily totals and means for both trip
	duration, and distance traveled in miles.


/interim/         := the interim dataset created from the data contained in
	the /raw/ folder. A notebook detailing how this dataset was created is 
	available in the /notebooks/ folder under /dataPreprocessing/.


/notableMentions/ := contains the data from interesting observations. In
	particular, individuals traveling at a high rate of speed or whose trips
	were outside of any possible dates.


/raw/             := the raw data as downloaded from the Biketown PDX website.
