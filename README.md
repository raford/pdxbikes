# pdxbikes
A data analysis project using Portland's Biketown PDX data.

**This is a new project that I am currently working on. I will be updating it as I go along. Once complete I will remove this line, and have a better README.md file**

The goal is to have this be a "full stack" data science project.

The end result will be a time series analysis report, a slideshow presentation showing interesting findings, and finally a dashboard that allows the user to explore the data in a more efficient manner.
