 A data analysis project using Portland's Biketown PDX data.

 This is a new project that I am currently working on.

The goal is to have this be a "full stack" data science project.

The end result will be a time series analysis report, a slideshow presentation showing interesting findings, and finally a dashboard that allows the user to explore the data in a more efficient manner.
